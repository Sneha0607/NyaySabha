## Introduction:
The COVID-19 situation had led to the disruption of many courts in India. But we know that “Justice can not be delayed at any cost”. That is why we need a solution for this issue, so that court hearings can take place in an efficient manner.

  A web application built only for the purpose of court hearings, where a moderator/clerk can create a meeting and the judge, lawyers, witnesses and viewers can join in it.
The meeting page that have a UI which would be inspired from a court setting with the Judge in the Centre and the two lawyers on either side. Also it would have a CourtRoom Box where the evidences can be sent.
